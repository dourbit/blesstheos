# NOTE some issues with bpkg:
# * global install with sudo doesn't work as bpkg is installed locally
# * local installs stick a deps/ in a current dir
# * package.json is a poor choice, as it overlaps with npm's package.json
# people are in fact using npm to deploy shell scripts
# npm is ok, except I rather run certain scripts without any install deps

# Installing from the source instead - see next block...
# The package below just a fork; plus it renames JSON.sh to JSON (I rather not)
