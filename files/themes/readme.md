# Themes

Some favorite terminal themes:

- [overgrowth](https://protesilaos.com/prot16-overgrowth)-dark
- [gruvbox](https://github.com/vifo/xfce4-terminal-colorschemes)-dark
- [ocarina](https://protesilaos.com/prot16-ocarina)-dark
- [neptune](https://protesilaos.com/prot16-neptune)-dark

On Linux, I started using Xfce4 Terminal as it is easier to configure.
Just open Preferences / Colors, and choose any of the above or other Presets...

URxvt and XTerm are currently hardcoded to the Overgrowth Dark theme.
